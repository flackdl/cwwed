# TODO - Google Chrome is now blocking insecure downloads that were generated from secure pages.  This is due to the fact
# that hyrax is running insecure as a container, but is behind a secure proxy (django), and hyrax is generating insecure download links as a result, which
# Cloudflare is trying to redirect to https but Chrome blocks it.

# Chrome error:
