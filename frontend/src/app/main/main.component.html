    CWWED - The COASTAL Act further requires NOAA to create a “Coastal Wind and Water Event Database” (CWWED) to provide the public access to “covered data” (the observations collected during the storm to assist with the assessment). NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) is developing the COASTAL Wind and Water Event Database (CWWED) and Geographical Web-based mapping Services (GWS) that support the COASTAL Act. CWWED serves as an interactive database that provides access to all data used by the Named Storm Event Model (NSEM) to derive PSAs and serves as an accessible repository for the PSA output so it can be referenced by all relevant stakeholders. CWWED receives the NSEM input from NOAA, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and academic members of the Digital Hurricane Consortium (DHC) as well as the derived PSA data products that are generated from the NSEM.
